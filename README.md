 # WEEK ONE CODE CHALLENGE
 
### Project Description
This particular javascript project entails 3 arithemetics.
Firstly is to give a function that prompts the user to input students marks.The input is between 0 - 100
Secondly is to write a functions which takes speeed of cars as input.If speed is less than 70, it should print "ok" otherwise for every km/s above the speed limit(70), it should give the driver one demerit point and
print the total number of demerits points.
Thirdly and lastly is a program whose major task is to calculate an individual's net salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits.It calculates the payee, NHIF Deductions, gross salary and net salary.
The project uses javascript to get the calculations.

# Getting Started

NB: One folder, with 3-4 files for each solution. Please note that a single file should only hold one solution.

2. Use JavaScript to wire down the solution.

3. Push the solution to the above repository once done.

4. Submit the repository link for grading.

5. Ensure your repository has a well written README.

NOTE: You are required to complete ALL the challenge

## Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator

### Description

Write a program that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then output the correct grade:

```
- A = 80 to 100
- B = 60 to 79
- C = 50 to 59
- D = 40 to 49
- E = less 40.
```

### Running the application

- Open the index.html file in Mozilla Firefox, Safari or any Chromium-based browser.

- If using VS Code, you can use the Live Server extension to run the file on the browser for live reloading.

- Click [HERE](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) to install the Live Server extension and to read instructions on how to use it.

- Open the context menu by right clicking anywhere on the page and select `Inspect` to launch the Developer Tools.

- Inside `grade_calculator.js`, invoke/call each of the functions, one at a time and with varied inputs, to test the different logic implementations and check the output on the console.

- Remember to comment out each execution once done to avoid confusion with the outputs.

## Challenge 2: Speed Detector

### Description

Write a program that takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80.
If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”.
Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

### Running the application

- With the `index.html` file still running in your browser (Check Challenge 1 above on how to do it), open the `speed_calculator.js` file.
- Invoke/call the function with different inputs/arguments, to test the different logic implementations and check the output on the console.

- Remember to comment out each function execution once done to avoid confusion with the outputs.

## Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator

### Description

Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits.
Calculate the PAYE (i.e. Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary.

NB: Use KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the links [HERE](https://www.aren.co.ke/payroll/taxrates.ht 'LINK') and [HERE](https://www.kra.go.ke/en/individual/calculate-tax/calculating-tax/paye)

### Running the application

- With the `index.html` file still running in your browser (Check Challenge 1 above on how to do it), open the `salary_calculator.js` file.
- Invoke/call the functions, one at a time and with different inputs/arguments, to test the different logic implementations and check the output on the console.

- Remember to comment out each function execution once done to avoid confusion with the outputs.
 
### How to use the project
you can use the project to output students marks, to output demerits of overspeeding vehicles and calculating an individual's net salary by getting inputs of basic salary and benefits.
